ðŸ¤– IBM Data Science Capstone â€“ Predictive Analysis (Classification)

Notebook: SpaceX_Machine Learning Prediction_Part_5.ipynb

Objective

Predict whether a Falcon 9 first stage landing will be successful using classification algorithms.

Steps
1. Loaded cleaned dataset (dataset_wrangled.csv).
2. Split data into training and test sets.
3. Applied StandardScaler for feature normalization.
4. Built four classifiers:
  Logistic Regression
  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  Decision Tree
  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
5.Tuned hyperparameters with GridSearchCV for each model.
6. Evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation.

Tools Used

Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib
